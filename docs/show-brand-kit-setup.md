# Show Brand Kit Setup

Brand setup should help each podcast feel distinct without forcing creators to design every visual element from scratch.

## User Goal

A creator should be able to add show branding once, preview how it affects presets and canvas layouts, and reuse it across future episodes.

## Relationship To Show Identity

Brand kit setup should connect to the surfaces where show identity appears:

- preset selection from `docs/preset-style-picker.md`
- caption emphasis from `docs/audio-caption-quality-review.md`
- canvas layers from `docs/canvas-layer-controls.md`
- thumbnails from `docs/thumbnail-cover-frame.md`
- intros and outros from `docs/intro-outro-builder.md`
- sponsor-safe placement from `docs/sponsor-placement-review.md`
- reusable templates from `docs/show-template-adaptation.md`
- export warnings in `docs/export-readiness-review.md`

## Brand Approach

Brand setup is distinct, not mandatory: creators should start from strong defaults, preview branding on real episode content, and refine the kit over time without being blocked from editing when inputs are incomplete.

## Brand Inputs

The setup should support:

- logo
- show colors
- type style preference
- lower-third style
- caption emphasis level
- background texture or image
- sponsor placement rules
- thumbnail or cover treatment

Inputs should remain optional. A creator should be able to start from strong defaults and refine the brand kit over time.

## Preview Surfaces

Brand choices should preview in the places they actually appear:

- preset cards
- speaker frames
- captions
- title moments
- lower-thirds
- b-roll callouts
- export thumbnail

The preview should use real episode speakers when available, not generic placeholder content.

## Guardrails

Branding should not reduce viewer clarity:

- captions stay readable
- speaker faces remain unobstructed
- sponsor marks do not crowd lower-thirds
- color contrast works for long-form viewing
- layouts still adapt to different speaker counts

When a brand choice creates a readability problem, the product should suggest a fix rather than silently rejecting it.

## Resolving Brand Conflicts

When a brand choice trips a guardrail, the creator should stay in control of the trade-off instead of having the choice silently changed or rejected. For each flagged conflict, the product should:

- show the specific readability problem and where it appears in the episode
- offer a suggested fix the creator can accept in one action
- let the creator keep the original brand choice with a visible readability warning
- let the creator adjust the underlying brand input rather than only the single instance
- apply the resolution to the current episode only or save it back to the show template
- preview the fix against real episode content before it is applied

A brand kit should never block a creator from previewing an episode. Unresolved conflicts should remain visible warnings the creator can revisit, not hard stops.

## Review States

The product should use brand kit status to drive preview and reuse behavior:

- **using defaults** — apply strong preset defaults when brand inputs are incomplete; do not block episode preview or editing
- **previewing** — show brand choices on real episode speakers across Preview Surfaces
- **conflict flagged** — surface the readability or overlap issue with a suggested fix; keep preview available
- **adjusted** — apply the chosen fix and refresh previews for the affected surface
- **accepted with warning** — keep the original brand choice with the publishing consequence visible; do not clear unrelated caption, framing, or sponsor warnings
- **saved to template** — carry approved brand inputs into `docs/show-template-adaptation.md` for future episodes without rewriting already exported episodes

Each state should describe what happens in preview, templates, and export readiness—not only the label on the brand input.

## Creator Controls

Offer simple actions:

- add or edit logo, colors, type style, and placement rules
- preview brand choices on preset cards, captions, lower-thirds, and thumbnails
- accept a suggested readability fix
- keep the original brand choice with a visible warning
- adjust the underlying brand input instead of only one instance
- apply a resolution to this episode or save it back to the show template

Avoid making brand setup mandatory before preview or forcing one house style across every podcast.

## Brand Version Freshness

When a creator updates the brand kit, episodes already in progress should make it easy to see whether they reflect the latest brand choices or an earlier version—without nagging or forcing a refresh.

Each in-progress episode should carry exactly one freshness status:

- on current brand — the episode already reflects the latest brand inputs; show no marker when everything is up to date
- older brand version — the episode was last branded before a kit change; surface a quiet inline marker on the affected preview surfaces, not a blocking banner
- refreshed — the creator pulled the latest brand inputs into this episode; clear the marker and update previews for the affected surfaces

The marker should be informational, never a hard stop. A creator should be able to keep previewing and editing an episode on an older brand version, and choose to refresh per surface or for the whole episode in one action. Refreshing should respect already-accepted readability choices rather than silently reintroducing a fix the creator declined.

Freshness is independent of conflict status: an episode can be on current brand and still have an accepted-with-note choice, or be on an older version with no conflicts at all. When both apply, show the conflict note and the freshness marker side by side rather than letting one hide the other. Already-exported episodes are never marked older; refreshing applies only to episodes still in progress.

## Reuse

A brand kit should attach to a show template but remain editable. Teams should be able to update future episodes without changing already exported episodes.

## Maintainer Acceptance Notes

Accept work that makes show identity reusable across presets, canvas edits, and exports. Close work that creates a single house style for every podcast, makes brand setup mandatory before creators can preview an episode, or clears unrelated publish-readiness warnings when a brand conflict is accepted with warning.
