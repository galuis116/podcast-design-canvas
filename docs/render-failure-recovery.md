# Render Failure Recovery

When preview or export rendering fails, the product should help creators recover without making them debug production infrastructure.

## User Goal

A creator should understand what part of the episode needs attention, retry safely, and keep working without losing edits.

## Failure Messages

Use viewer-facing explanations:

- captions could not be included
- a b-roll asset is missing
- a speaker video file is unavailable
- audio mix could not be prepared
- thumbnail export failed
- final file could not be created

Avoid raw stack traces, worker names, or pipeline logs in the default user view.

## Recovery Actions

Offer direct actions:

- retry export
- replace missing asset
- skip optional visual
- export without captions
- return to issue moment
- create review copy instead
- contact support with diagnostics

Each action should explain the effect on the final episode.

## Recovery Status

A creator who hits a failed render should always know where recovery stands, without watching a progress log. Each failed render should carry a clear status:

- failed — the render stopped and needs a decision before retrying
- retrying — the creator chose an action and the export is running again
- recovered — a retry or fix produced a usable preview or export
- needs creator input — recovery is blocked until the creator replaces an asset or fixes a readiness issue
- exported around the issue — the creator finished by skipping an optional visual or captions
- set aside — the creator stepped away but kept edits without finishing this export

Keep the status tied to the chosen recovery action rather than infrastructure progress:

- moving from failed to retrying should restate the effect described in Recovery Actions above
- needs creator input should point at the specific missing asset or the relevant warning in `docs/export-readiness-review.md`, not a generic error
- recovered should show the last successful preview or export so the creator can confirm the fix
- set aside should rely on Preservation Rules below so no edits are lost while the export stays unfinished

A status should describe recovery progress only; it should never block the creator from returning to the issue moment or creating a review copy instead, and it should not restate the readiness checks owned by `docs/export-readiness-review.md`.

## Preservation Rules

Failures should not erase:

- canvas edits
- caption corrections
- approved b-roll
- metadata
- comments
- template changes
- export readiness decisions

Failed exports should return creators to the relevant warning surface in `docs/export-readiness-review.md` when recovery requires fixing a readiness issue.

The product should clearly show the last successful preview or export when available.

## Maintainer Acceptance Notes

Accept work that makes render and export failures recoverable for creators. Close work that exposes infrastructure internals, loses episode decisions, or leaves creators with only a generic retry button.
